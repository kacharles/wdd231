                <p>
                    Have you thought about getting certificates that will prepare you to get a job and make more money on your way to a degree? BYU-Pathway Worldwide helps you do just that. 
                    BYU-Pathway Worldwide in association with BYU-Idaho and Ensign College is the preferred pathway to a university degree. It offers access to online certificates and degrees 
                    in the area of business, technology, health, communication, family and professional studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every degree program is built into certificates and a certificate is typically made out of five courses and can be completed in one year or less. In order to build a degree, 
                    simply select three marketable certificates which stack into an associate degree and a bachelor's degree for no additional cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the best parts about earning certificates on the way to a degree, is that you can get a job or improve your employment, way before graduating. More students report making 
                    more money after completing their first certificate, and then seeing even bigger income boost after completing their bachelor's degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The preferred start to a degree begins with PathwayConnect, which includes foundational academic and religion courses that help students see increased success. All courses count toward 
                    your degree!
